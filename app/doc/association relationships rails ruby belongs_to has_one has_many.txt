if X belongs_to Y, then create table Y with belongs_to: X
  table X has foreign_key to Y 
  table Y can have many Xâ€™s

if X has_one Y, then create table Y with belongs_to: X
  table Y has foreign_key to X

So, has_one is an actual 1:1 mapping. X has one Y and Y has one X.
  
Belongs_to paired with has_many.  

Only the table with the foreign key has the belongs_to schema column.
  not the table with a has_one relation
