WAIT MVP model-view-presenter

TODO see if partials under application (such as _edit_nested.html.erb) should be in views/layouts so they are automatically looked up.
   combine with render partial: :edit_nested, object: instance
   render collection: @instances

TODO simplify controller and get rid of json code that I don't understand yet.
